# Python Name Manager

This is a simple Python console program that allows users to:

- Add a name to the list
- Delete a name from the list
- View the entire name list
- Check if a name is registered

It uses basic Python concepts such as:

- Functions with parameters
- Conditionals (if/else)
- List operations (append, remove, check with `in`)
- Looping with `while True`
- Simple text menu system

Great for beginners who are learning Python fundamentals and want to build small, useful programs.
